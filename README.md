# JavaScript-Calculator
For my new education (Software Developer) I had to make an admission project; a simple calculator in JavaScript.
Live demo: https://calculator.mj-preview.nl/

### The calculator has the following functions:
- Error message if the number is less than 1 (0).
- Error message if you do not choose how to perform the calculation.
- It shows whether your own calculation is correct or not.

If you love this project and you appreciate my work.. You might consider buying me a coffee. ☕️
